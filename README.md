### Model-Based clustering with Missing Data

The Advanced Foundations of Statistics course project aims to replicate the simulation
outlined in the "Model-Based Clustering and Outlier Detection with Missing Data (MAR)" paper by Cristina 
Tortora and Hung Tong. We will utilize the 'MixtureMissing' package for this task and 
apply it to a real-world dataset, specifically the 'Music-Genre' dataset obtained from 
the Spotify API. Clustering will be performed using the Multivariate Contaminated Normal 
Mixture (MCNM) model.
